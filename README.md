## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal was to explore and visualize key performance metrics to help answer 8 core strategic questions:

1. Which platforms and post types generate the highest engagement or views?
2. What content categories (e.g., product promotion, educational) drive the best performance across different regions?
3. How do performance metrics vary by platform, post format, or hashtag usage?
4. What are the ideal days and hours to publish content for maximum engagement?
5. Are there regional differences in engagement and click-through performance?
6. What hashtags are most effective in increasing impressions or clicks?
7. Which countries or regions consistently show high video view counts or live stream interest?
8. Are there correlations between engagement levels and content categories or publishing time?
